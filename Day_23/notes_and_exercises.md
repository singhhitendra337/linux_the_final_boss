- **Common Interview Topics:**
  - Filesystem hierarchy, permissions, process management, networking, scripting, troubleshooting, security, automation

- **Real-World Scenarios:**
  - Troubleshoot a slow server: check CPU, memory, disk, network, logs
  - Recover from accidental file deletion: use backups, `extundelete`, `testdisk`
  - Secure a public web server: firewall, permissions, updates, monitoring
  - Automate user onboarding: scripts, templates, version control
  - Migrate data between servers: `rsync`, `scp`, downtime planning

- **Best Practices:**
  - Always document changes and configs
  - Use version control for scripts and configs
  - Test in staging before production
  - Monitor and alert on key metrics
  - Backup before making major changes



- **Troubleshooting Methodology:**
  1. **Gather Information:** What, when, where, who, how
  2. **Reproduce Issue:** Consistent reproduction helps isolation
  3. **Check Logs:** System, application, security logs
  4. **Monitor Resources:** CPU, memory, disk, network
  5. **Test Hypotheses:** Make one change at a time
  6. **Document Solution:** For future reference

- **Common Scenarios:**
  ```bash
  # High load investigation
  top, htop                        # Process overview
  vmstat 1                         # System stats
  iostat -x 1                      # I/O stats
  sar -u 1 10                      # CPU utilization
  
  # Disk space issues
  df -h                            # Filesystem usage
  du -sh /*                        # Directory sizes
  lsof +L1                         # Deleted but open files
  
  # Network troubleshooting
  ping, traceroute, mtr            # Connectivity
  netstat -tuln, ss -tuln          # Port status
  tcpdump, wireshark               # Packet analysis
  ```

## Sample Exercises
1. Troubleshoot a server with high load and slow response.
2. Recover from a full root filesystem.
3. Investigate and resolve network connectivity issues.
4. Secure a newly deployed web server.
5. Plan and execute a zero-downtime application deployment.
6. Diagnose and fix a service that won't start.
7. Implement automated monitoring and alerting.

## Solutions
1. **High Load Troubleshooting:**
   ```bash
   # Step 1: Identify the bottleneck
   top                              # Overall system view
   htop                             # Interactive process viewer
   
   # Step 2: Analyze specific resources
   vmstat 1 5                       # Memory and CPU stats
   iostat -x 1 5                    # Disk I/O analysis
   sar -u 1 10                      # CPU utilization over time
   
   # Step 3: Investigate processes
   ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -10   # Top CPU consumers
   ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10   # Top memory consumers
   
   # Step 4: Check for issues
   dmesg | tail -20                 # Kernel messages
   journalctl -f                    # Live system logs
   ```

2. **Full Root Filesystem Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Find large files/directories
   du -sh /* | sort -hr | head -10
   
   # Clean up common locations
   journalctl --vacuum-time=7d      # Clean old logs
   apt autoremove && apt autoclean  # Remove unused packages
   
   # Find deleted but open files
   lsof +L1
   
   # Emergency cleanup
   find /tmp -type f -atime +7 -delete
   find /var/log -name "*.log" -size +100M
   ```

3. **Network Connectivity Issues:**
   ```bash
   # Layer-by-layer approach
   ip link show                     # Physical/data link layer
   ip addr show                     # Network layer
   ping gateway_ip                  # Local connectivity
   ping 8.8.8.8                     # Internet connectivity
   nslookup domain.com              # DNS resolution
   
   # Port and service testing
   telnet target_host port          # Port connectivity
   ss -tuln | grep :80              # Service listening
   ```

4. **Web Server Security:**
   ```bash
   # Firewall configuration
   ufw enable
   ufw allow 22/tcp
   ufw allow 80/tcp
   ufw allow 443/tcp
   
   # SSH hardening
   # Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   PermitRootLogin no
   PasswordAuthentication no
   Port 2222
   
   # Install fail2ban
   apt install fail2ban
   systemctl enable fail2ban
   ```

5. **Zero-Downtime Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Blue-green deployment approach
   # 1. Deploy to staging environment
   rsync -av app/ staging:/var/www/app-new/
   
   # 2. Test thoroughly
   curl -H "Host: myapp.com" http://staging-ip/health
   
   # 3. Switch traffic (load balancer/DNS)
   # Update load balancer configuration
   
   # 4. Monitor and rollback if needed
   tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
   ```
