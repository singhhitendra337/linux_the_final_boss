# Day 25: System Hardening

## Learning Objectives
By the end of Day 25, you will:
- Implement comprehensive system hardening measures
- Secure services and network access
- Configure security monitoring and auditing
- Apply security frameworks and best practices
- Understand compliance requirements

**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours

## Notes

## Why System Hardening Matters
- Reduces attack surface and risk of compromise.
- Essential for compliance, security, and production reliability.

- **Security Principles:**
  - **Least Privilege:** Minimum necessary access
  - **Defense in Depth:** Multiple security layers
  - **Fail Secure:** Secure defaults when systems fail
  - **Security by Design:** Built-in security measures

## Sample Exercises
1. Harden SSH configuration and test security.
2. Remove unnecessary services and packages.
3. Configure comprehensive firewall rules.
4. Set up intrusion detection and monitoring.
5. Implement file integrity monitoring.
6. Create security audit checklist.
7. Configure system-wide security policies.

## Solutions
1. **SSH Hardening:**
   ```bash
   # Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   PermitRootLogin no
   PasswordAuthentication no
   PubkeyAuthentication yes
   Port 2222
   Protocol 2
   MaxAuthTries 3
   ClientAliveInterval 300
   ClientAliveCountMax 2
   
   # Restart SSH service
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   
   # Test configuration
   sudo sshd -t
   ```

2. **Service Removal:**
   ```bash
   # List all services
   systemctl list-unit-files --type=service
   
   # Disable unnecessary services
   sudo systemctl disable --now avahi-daemon
   sudo systemctl disable --now cups
   sudo systemctl disable --now bluetooth
   
   # Remove unnecessary packages
   sudo apt purge telnet rsh-client rsh-redone-client
   ```

3. **Firewall Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # UFW setup
   sudo ufw --force reset
   sudo ufw default deny incoming
   sudo ufw default allow outgoing
   sudo ufw allow 2222/tcp comment 'SSH'
   sudo ufw allow 80/tcp comment 'HTTP'
   sudo ufw allow 443/tcp comment 'HTTPS'
   sudo ufw enable
   
   # Verify rules
   sudo ufw status verbose
   ```

4. **Intrusion Detection:**
   ```bash
   # Install and configure fail2ban
   sudo apt install fail2ban
   
   # Create local configuration
   sudo cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local
   
   # Edit jail.local
   [sshd]
   enabled = true
   port = 2222
   filter = sshd
   logpath = /var/log/auth.log
   maxretry = 3
   bantime = 3600
   
   sudo systemctl restart fail2ban
   ```

5. **File Integrity Monitoring:**
   ```bash
   # Install AIDE
   sudo apt install aide
   
   # Initialize database
   sudo aideinit
   
   # Copy database
   sudo cp /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db
   
   # Run check
   sudo aide --check
   
   # Schedule regular checks
   echo "0 2 * * * root /usr/bin/aide --check" >> /etc/crontab
   ```

6. **Security Audit Checklist:**
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # security-audit.sh
   
   echo "=== Security Audit Report ==="
   echo "Date: $(date)"
   echo
   
   # Check for users with UID 0
   echo "Users with UID 0:"
   awk -F: '$3==0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
   echo
   
   # Check for empty passwords
   echo "Users with empty passwords:"
   awk -F: '$2=="" {print $1}' /etc/shadow
   echo
   
   # Check listening services
   echo "Listening services:"
   ss -tuln
   echo
   
   # Check failed login attempts
   echo "Recent failed logins:"
   grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log | tail -5
   ```

7. **System-wide Security Policies:**
   ```bash
   # Password policies in /etc/login.defs
   PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
   PASS_MIN_DAYS 7
   PASS_WARN_AGE 14
   PASS_MIN_LEN 12
   
   # Kernel security parameters in /etc/sysctl.conf
   net.ipv4.ip_forward=0
   net.ipv4.conf.all.send_redirects=0
   net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=0
   net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_source_route=0
   kernel.dmesg_restrict=1
   
   # Apply settings
   sudo sysctl -p
   ```
